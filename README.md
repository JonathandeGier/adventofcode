# Advent of Code
Welcome to my Advent of Code GitHub repo. At the moment I have solved all puzzles for year 2015 and 2021 in python and I am currently working on the other years.

## How to run
### 1. Provide the input
There are 2 ways to provide the input for the solutions. <br>
The first way is to put the input file in `solutions\<year>\input\input<day>.txt`. Where `year` and `day` are the spesific year and day of the puzzle. <br>

The second way is to get your Avdent of Code session and put it in the file `session` (no file extensions) in the root of the project. This will get your personal input automatically create the input file explained above.

### 2. Run the solution
Execute the python files from the root directory. <br>
Examples:
- `python .\solutions\2015\day1.py`
- `python .\solutions\2015\all.py`
- `python .\solutions\2021\day14.py`
